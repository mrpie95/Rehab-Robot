One day, I went to the Melbourne zoo with my parents. -  Have you ever been to the zoo?
We saw a lot of birds and animals. My favorite animal was the Elephant. - Do you have a favorite animal?


The next animal I saw was a Gorilla. When I went close to the Gorilla, it started dancing like - *gesture*.

We then saw a kangaroo! The kangaroo *gesture_"hop hop"* past us.

Then we saw a lot of monkeys! The monkeys were very funny! When they saw me they started jumping and making noises like - *sound+gesture*
